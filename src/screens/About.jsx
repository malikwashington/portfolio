      <p>
        Hi, My name is Malik, I'm from Harlem, USA. I am a Software Engineer
        with a passion for solving problems, both with computers and with the
        most complex things we know: people.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        I have a background of technology sales, technical sales support and
        Information Technology services. Outside of my traditional technical
        experience, I also bring to the table a 15+ year career as an
        Entrepreneur and Professional Musician.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entrepreneurship and performing around the world have given me the
        opportunity to negotiate different modes of thought, action and
        effective leadership styles. I bring a worldly, unique and diverse
        perspective that challenges stagnation, promotes creativity, and
        produces practical, effective solutions for real-world business
        challenges.
